# GPA-Converter

This [web application](http://grade-converter.herokuapp.com/) was created using **Flask** and hosted on **Heroku**.  
  
  The application takes in a user entered list of grade information including course name, number of credits, and final grade and computes the overall GPA in the Ontario Medical School Application Service (OMSAS) scale. The goal of this application is to convert a user's GPA relative to their school's grading scale (ex. York University has a 9.0 grade scale) into a grade relative to a 4.0 grading scale.  
    
  In the future I hope to improve the UI and add some JavaScript functionality.
